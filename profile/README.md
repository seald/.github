Seald allows you to seamlessly integrate state-of-the-art end-to-end encryption — the highest level of data security — into any web or mobile app. The SDK handles all the complex cryptography and key exchanges.

This comprehensive measure protects data throughout its entire lifecycle, from one client-side to another client-side, including when stored and while being processed by backend systems. Our robust encryption effectively mitigates risks associated with data access and handling, safeguarding sensitive information against potential breaches.

## Quick Start

Before starting, you need a Seald account. You can create a trial account on our staging environment here: [https://www.seald.io/create-sdk](https://www.seald.io/create-sdk).

Once your trial account is created, you can [access the administration panel](https://dashboard.staging-0.seald.io/) and retrieve the necessary information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This allows you to create an account on our test environment only.
This environment cannot be migrated to a production environment. There is no
SLA, and data may be deleted. To create a production account, [contact us](mailto:contact@seald.io).
